This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Context
It’s important to know what Mother Nature is going to throw at you each day – what if you wear flip flops because it’s sunny and 65 degrees in the morning and then it snows all afternoon (this is Colorado, after all).

As web developers you’re going to be living in the context of the web. With this next project you will be interacting with a web-api. Ultimately this is going to be a preview for what the real world is going to look like for most of you. Data is important and thats what the API provides. As a web-developer you will be giving value to that data by visualizing and organizing that data for your user base.

In this project you will be getting your first real interactions with ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, and managing the state of your application.

## Required Technology
ReactJS
fetch for api requests
weather underground API
Use this react starter kit repo.

## Requirements
Your weather underground API key should not be stored on github. Store it in a seperate file. This file should be added to your .gitignore file.

Your app should have at a minimum the following components.

App
Welcome
Search
Current Weather
7 Hour Forecast
10 Day Forecast
Card (used in 7 hour and 10 day)
Design Requirements
Your Readme should include wireframes of your app.

## To use:

Install the dependencies:

      npm install

To fire up a development server:

Once the server is running, you can visit:

      http://localhost:8080 to run your application.
